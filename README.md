Reports are crafted to present information and analysis about a problem, often proposing solutions, and are structured with clearly divided sections such as a title page, table of contents, executive summary, introduction, literature review, methodologies, findings, discussion, conclusion, and recommendations. Each section serves a specific purpose, from summarizing the report to detailing the findings and analyses.

A well-crafted email should have a professional email address, a concise and informative subject line, and an appropriate salutation based on the relationship with the recipient. The body of the email should be clear, concise, and actionable, ending with a proper sign-off and signature. Proofreading for errors and ensuring the correct recipients are included is crucial. Scheduling emails for appropriate times and following up if there is no response within a few days is recommended. The lecture also provides templates and examples for different types of emails, including those to new contacts, groups, and follow-up communications, along with FAQs about using CC and BCC fields.

The "Memo Writing" lecture details the purpose and structure of memos, used for internal communication within organizations to inform recipients about specific issues, solutions, or events. Memos should be brief, clear, and easy to read, typically addressing a single subject. The standard format includes a heading with recipient, sender, date, and subject, followed by an opening statement, context, call to action, discussion, and closing. Optional additions like summaries and attachments can be included if necessary. The memo should be professional, polite, and focused on actionable plans. The lecture also highlights the differences between memos and other forms of communication such as emails, letters, and press releases, and provides examples of memos for various business scenarios.
- _Language for Presentations_<br/>
The "Language for Presentations" lecture focuses on techniques to enhance the flow and clarity of English presentations. Effective presentations are structured with a clear introduction, main body, and conclusion, using specific linking phrases to guide the audience through the different sections. The introduction should include a greeting, presentation topic, outline, and question policy. The main body should be divided into parts, each beginning and ending with transitional phrases. Sequencing phrases help in listing goals and processes. The conclusion should summarize the main points, make recommendations, and invite questions, ending with a thank you to the audience. Memorizing these linking phrases can improve the presentation’s structure and boost the speaker’s confidence.
